=begin INSTRUCTIONS. Ada Calculator, Due August 8, 2018
The program should have support for these four operations
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The program should accept both the name (add) and the symbol (+) for
each possible operation. The program should handle unexpected user input
